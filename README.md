# 🎬 TMDB Movies Data Analysis


Investigate a Dataset – Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

📖 Overview

This project analyzes a dataset from The Movie Database (TMDB) to uncover insights about movie ratings, popularity, and financial characteristics. Using Python and essential data analysis libraries, I perform cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual storytelling through visualizations.

🔍 Key Questions Explored

Which genres tend to produce the highest-rated movies?

How have movie ratings changed over time?

What traits are common among the top-performing films?

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Python	Data analysis & visualization
Pandas	Data manipulation
NumPy	Numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn	Visualizations
Jupyter Notebook	Interactive analysis environment
🧹 Data Wrangling Steps

Data quality assessment and cleaning

Handling missing and duplicated data

Correcting data types for financial fields

Removing unrealistic zero-budget or zero-revenue movies

📊 Visual Insights (Examples)

Most popular genres over time

Trends in movie ratings

Rating differences between genres

Top-rated movies by release year

(Visualizations are viewable directly in the notebook or HTML report.)

🏁 Results Summary

Certain genres consistently receive stronger audience reception

Ratings vary noticeably across decades

Movie popularity does not always equal high ratings

Proper data cleaning greatly improves accuracy of conclusions
